<!-- CONCLUSION -->
## Conclusion
In conclusion, by successfully launching this project, we had successfully applied and collaborated as a team in balancing our unique strengths in both efficiency & effective problem resolution.¬†¬†

More importantly, we now understand the relative importance of web development theories which are essential to the everyday use that we have taken for granted.
